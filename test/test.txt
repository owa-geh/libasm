The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, in a moment of reasoned lucidity which is almost unique among its current tally of five million, nine hundred and seventy-five thousand, five hundred and nine pages, says of the Sirius Cybernetic Corporation products that 'it is very easy to be blinded to the essential uselessness of them by the sense of achievement you get from getting them to work at all. In other words - and this is the rock-solid principle on which the whole of the Corporation's galaxy-wide success is founded - their fundamental design flaws are completely hidden by their superficial design flaws.'

					Douglas Adams, "So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish"
